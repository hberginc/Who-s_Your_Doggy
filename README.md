## IMAGES:

### 1. images DogBreed Classifier:

#### Objective: Classify Rees
Yes this has been done before and probably is done often, however, I am personally interested in classifying my own dog so I can finally answer everyone's question about what kind of breed she looks like at least.

#### the data:

http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/

    120 dog breeds
    ~150 images per class
    Total images: 20,580
   
#### The Challenge
Due to the high volume of images, I think I would need to utilize an AWS instance which I do not feel prepared to do but will work my best to have it done over the weekend. 
Since there are 120 dog breeds, I may need to scale down my concept to only a few breeds at first and include more if I am getting the hang of image processing early enough in the week. If I don't do this project for my capstone, I am happy to work on it after our class wraps up as well so I am not offended if my other projects get the green light and this one doesnt.


### 2. images (pnemonia or tumor)

### The data

Taking a look at the 5856 x-ray images labeled I am hoping to create an image classfier that will detect pnemonia from the image of the chest

Take a look at the 253 files of image MRI data to dettect if there is a tumor or not
