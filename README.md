### DogBreed Classifier:

#### Objective: Classify minimum of 5 different dog breeds based on images: I am personally interested in classifying my own dog so I can finally answer everyone's question about what kind of breed she looks like. 


#### the data:

http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/

    120 dog breeds
    ~150 images per class
    Total images: 20,580
   
#### The Challenge
Due to the high volume of images, I think I would need to utilize an AWS instance which I do not feel prepared to do but will work my best to have it done over the weekend. 
Since there are 120 dog breeds, I may need to scale down my concept to only a few breeds at first and include more if I am getting the hang of image processing early enough in the week. If I don't do this project for my capstone, I am happy to work on it after our class wraps up as well so I am not offended if my other projects get the green light and this one doesnt.
