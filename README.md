# Who's Your Doggy

## Motivation

Dogs have been artificially bred by humans over the years to highlight desirable work and pet qualities. Due to the multitude of purposes, dogs have become the most diverse species on the planet.

The day you bring home your furry ball of love from the animal shelter is typically exciting and full of joy, however, the return rate back to the shelter can vary between 5 and 20%. The most common reasons why a dog may be returned are unexpected costs, human health issues, and a variety unwanted behaviors. Doing some reasearch about the personality and behaviors you are looking for can help prepare you for your shelter visit, however, coming home with a miss classified mixed breed is highly likely due to dog breed diverstiy. 

Personally, classifying my own rez dog with more accurate breeds than the generic, "Australian Shepherd Mix", is my personal motivation for the beginning of the project.

The final 25 breeds I chose to classify are:
