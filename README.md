## TRUE DESIRED DATASET (Probably Too Complicated)
I am highly interested in doing a time series and image project and the data found on openneuro.org/datasets have a ton of great work but I really struggled to understand if I am able to work with the MRI images since they are continuous slices creating one large image. I would love guidance on any of the following: datasets: 

https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000201/versions/1.0.3 ("This multimodal dataset can be used to investigate effects of sleep deprivation as well as cross-sectional relationships between various participant characteristics and brain imaging parameters. Samples of serum and DNA are available for additional analyses. Thus, this dataset could be used for discovery or independent validation of associations found in other datasets. Possibly identifying features and variables have been censored in order to safeguard participants\u2019 integrity. We encourage researchers to use the published dataset freely and ask that they cite the respective data sources as well as this paper. For any analyses involving censored data, our intention is to share data with colleagues by arrangement, limited in each particular case by regulations pertaining to data integrity as well as by the participants\u2019 consent, and we encourage researchers to contact us.)


https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000171/versions/00001 (The present dataset uses functional MRI and an validated emotional music
and nonmusical auditory paradigm (Lepping, et al., 2015) to examine how
neural processing of emotionally provocative auditory stimuli is altered
in depression.) -classify if the brain is hearing music or not




## IMAGES:

### 1. images DogBreed Classifier:

#### Objective: Classify Rees
Yes this has been done before and probably is done often, however, I am personally interested in classifying my own dog so I can finally answer everyone's question about what kind of breed she looks like at least.

#### the data:

http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/

    120 dog breeds
    ~150 images per class
    Total images: 20,580
   
#### The Challenge
Due to the high volume of images, I think I would need to utilize an AWS instance which I do not feel prepared to do but will work my best to have it done over the weekend. 
Since there are 120 dog breeds, I may need to scale down my concept to only a few breeds at first and include more if I am getting the hang of image processing early enough in the week. If I don't do this project for my capstone, I am happy to work on it after our class wraps up as well so I am not offended if my other projects get the green light and this one doesnt.


### 2. images (pnemonia or tumor)

### The data

Taking a look at the 5856 x-ray images labeled I am hoping to create an image classfier that will detect pnemonia from the image of the chest

### The data

Take a look at the 253 files of image MRI data to dettect if there is a tumor or not




## TIMESERIES (NOT MY FAVORITE IDEAS!)

### 3. Predict Unemployment or Inflation rates
