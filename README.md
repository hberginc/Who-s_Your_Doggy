# Who's Your Doggy

### Motivation

Dogs have been artificially bred by humans over the years to highlight desirable work and pet qualities. Due to the multitude of purposes, dogs have become the most diverse species on the planet.

The day you bring home your furry ball of love from the animal shelter is typically exciting and full of joy, however, the return rate back to the shelter can vary between 5 and 20%. The most common reasons why a dog may be returned are unexpected costs, human health issues, and a variety unwanted behaviors. Doing some reasearch about the personality and behaviors you are looking for can help prepare you for your shelter visit, however, coming home with a miss classified mixed breed is highly likely due to dog breed diverstiy. 

Personally, classifying my own rez dog with more accurate breeds than the generic, "Australian Shepherd Mix", is my personal motivation for the beginning of the project. 


#### About the data:

This set of images comes from the well known "Standford Dog dataset" http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/

The data contains the following:
    120 dog breeds
    ~150 images per class
    Total images: 20,580
   
Due to imense ammount of dog classifications, I started initially with only five random breeds and eventually utilized a total of 25 breeds with wich to work. 

The final 25 breeds I classified are:

#### The Challenge
Due to the high volume of images, I think I would need to utilize an AWS instance which I do not feel prepared to do but will work my best to have it done over the weekend. 
Since there are 120 dog breeds, I may need to scale down my concept to only a few breeds at first and include more if I am getting the hang of image processing early enough in the week. If I don't do this project for my capstone, I am happy to work on it after our class wraps up as well so I am not offended if my other projects get the green light and this one doesnt.
